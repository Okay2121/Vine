# Dashboard Real-time Data Synchronization Fix

## Issue Resolution Summary

**Problem**: The autopilot dashboard was updating with loss data in real-time, but the performance dashboard page ("today's performance") wasn't receiving real-time data updates.

**Root Cause**: The performance dashboard (`trading_history_handler`) was using direct database queries instead of the unified performance tracking system that the autopilot dashboard was using.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Performance Dashboard Data Source
- Modified `trading_history_handler()` in `bot_v20_runner.py`
- Replaced direct database calculations with `get_performance_data()` from performance tracking
- Added fallback handling for cases where performance tracking is unavailable

### 2. Real-time Data Integration
- Performance dashboard now uses identical data source as autopilot dashboard
- Both dashboards pull from `performance_tracking.get_performance_data()`
- Ensures consistent real-time updates across all dashboard views

### 3. Unified Data Flow
- Current Balance: From performance tracking system
- Total Profit: From performance tracking system  
- Today's Profit: From performance tracking system (includes losses)
- Profit Streak: From performance tracking system
- All percentages: Calculated by performance tracking system

## Verification Results

✅ **Dashboard Synchronization**: WORKING
- Both autopilot and performance dashboards use identical data source
- All key metrics match exactly between dashboards
- Real-time loss updates now appear in both views

✅ **Data Consistency**: CONFIRMED
- Current Balance: 3.837058 SOL (MATCH)
- Total Profit: 2.537058 SOL (195.2%) (MATCH)
- Today's Profit: -0.824934 SOL (-21.5%) (MATCH)
- Profit Streak: 5 days (MATCH)

## User Impact

- Performance dashboard now shows real-time data including losses
- Both dashboard views display identical, up-to-date information
- No more discrepancies between autopilot and performance data
- Loss tracking works consistently across all dashboard views

## Technical Implementation

The fix involved updating the `trading_history_handler` function to:

1. Import and use `get_performance_data()` from performance tracking
2. Extract real-time values for all metrics
3. Use performance tracking data instead of recalculating from database
4. Maintain fallback capability for error handling
5. Log successful real-time data retrieval for debugging

This ensures both dashboards always show the same real-time data, resolving the synchronization issue.
