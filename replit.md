# Solana Memecoin Trading Bot

## Overview
This is a sophisticated Telegram-based Solana memecoin trading bot that provides automated trading capabilities with a comprehensive user management system. The bot simulates realistic trading experiences while offering admin tools for trade broadcasting and user management. It's designed for production deployment with robust database handling and optimized performance for 500+ concurrent users.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask Web Application**: Main application server handling webhook endpoints and health monitoring
- **Telegram Bot API**: Direct API-based bot implementation using polling for better reliability
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL (production) with SQLite fallback, featuring connection pooling and retry logic
- **Auto-Trading Simulation**: Background system generating realistic trade histories for users

### Frontend Architecture
- **Telegram Interface**: Primary user interface through Telegram bot interactions
- **Admin Dashboard**: Telegram-based admin panel for user management and trade broadcasting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards accessible via web endpoints

## Key Components

### 1. Bot Core (`bot_v20_runner.py`)
- Singleton pattern implementation preventing multiple bot instances
- Enhanced duplicate message protection with graceful HTTP 409 error handling
- Optimized polling with 30-second timeout and batch processing
- Smart trade message parsing for admin buy/sell commands

### 2. Database Management
- **Connection Handler** (`database_connection_handler.py`): Robust connection management with NullPool for production
- **Monitoring System** (`database_monitoring.py`): Proactive health checks and automated cleanup
- **Stability Layer** (`database_stability_system.py`): Error-resistant operations preventing SQLAlchemy crashes

### 3. Trading System
- **Simple Trade Handler** (`simple_trade_handler.py`): Parses "Buy $TOKEN PRICE TX_LINK" format
- **Smart Balance Allocator** (`smart_balance_allocator.py`): Distributes trade results proportionally to user balances
- **Auto Trading History** (`utils/auto_trading_history.py`): Generates realistic trading backgrounds for new users

### 4. User Management
- **Models** (`models.py`): Comprehensive database schema with user status, transactions, and trading positions
- **Balance Manager** (`balance_manager.py`): Safe balance adjustments with transaction logging
- **Admin Tools**: Complete user lifecycle management through Telegram interface

## Data Flow

### User Registration Flow
1. User starts bot with `/start` command
2. System creates user record with referral tracking
3. User deposits minimum amount to activate trading
4. Auto-trading history generation begins

### Trade Processing Flow
1. Admin sends trade in format: "Buy $TOKEN 0.0041 https://solscan.io/tx/abc123"
2. System parses and validates trade message
3. For sells, matches with existing buy positions
4. Calculates ROI and updates all user balances proportionally
5. Sends personalized notifications to users

### Database Operations Flow
1. All operations go through stability layer with retry logic
2. Health monitoring runs every 60 seconds
3. Automated cleanup removes old records to manage size
4. Connection pooling optimizes resource usage

## Recent Changes

### P/L Calculation Fix - Deposits No Longer Count as Profit (June 19, 2025)
- **Fixed critical P/L calculation logic** where deposits were incorrectly counted as trading profit/loss
- **Root cause**: System treated all balance increases (deposits, admin adjustments) as profit instead of baseline
- **Solution implemented**:
  - Updated `performance_tracking.py` to exclude deposits from P/L calculations
  - Enhanced P/L logic to only count actual trading profits/losses (`trade_profit`, `trade_loss` transactions)
  - Fixed initial deposit tracking to properly set baseline from actual deposits
  - Added automatic initial deposit correction for users with missing baseline values
- **Components fixed**:
  - `get_performance_data()` - Now calculates P/L from trading transactions only
  - Initial deposit auto-correction for users with 0.00 baseline values
  - Performance dashboard now shows proper deposit amounts instead of 0.00
- **Result**: Dashboard correctly displays initial deposit amounts and 0.00 P/L until actual trades are made
- **Testing**: Verified user with 0.61 SOL from deposits shows 0.00 P/L (0.0%) as expected

### Admin Balance Adjustment HTTP 400 Fix (June 19, 2025)
- **Fixed critical admin adjust balance button disconnect** caused by Markdown parsing errors
- **Root cause**: Special characters in usernames and Markdown formatting causing HTTP 400 "can't parse entities" errors
- **Solution implemented**:
  - Removed all Markdown formatting from admin adjust balance messages
  - Updated user lookup, confirmation, and result messages to use plain text
  - Enhanced error handling throughout the balance adjustment workflow
  - Fixed message parsing issues with usernames containing special characters (_, *, [, ], @)
- **Components fixed**:
  - `admin_adjust_balance_handler()` - Initial message now uses plain text
  - `admin_adjust_balance_user_id_handler()` - User found message without Markdown
  - `admin_adjust_balance_amount_handler()` - Confirmation message in plain text
  - `admin_confirm_adjustment_handler()` - Result messages without formatting issues
- **Result**: Admin can now successfully adjust user balances without HTTP 400 errors for all username types
- **Testing**: Verified complete workflow from user lookup to balance adjustment completion

- **Streak calculation fix**:
  - Updated autopilot dashboard streak logic to calculate net daily P/L
  - Enhanced performance tracking system to use actual net P/L for streak determination
  - Fixed streak counting to only increment on days with positive net P/L
  - Ensured consistent streak calculation across both dashboard systems
- **Result**: Both dashboards now consistently use P/L terminology, accurately display gains/losses, and properly calculate streaks based on net P/L

### Autopilot Dashboard Real-time Data Connection Fix (June 15, 2025)
