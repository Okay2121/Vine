# Solana Memecoin Trading Bot

## Overview
This is a sophisticated Telegram-based Solana memecoin trading bot that provides automated trading capabilities with a comprehensive user management system. The bot simulates realistic trading experiences while offering admin tools for trade broadcasting and user management. It's designed for production deployment with robust database handling and optimized performance for 500+ concurrent users.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask Web Application**: Main application server handling webhook endpoints and health monitoring
- **Telegram Bot API**: Direct API-based bot implementation using polling for better reliability
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL (production) with SQLite fallback, featuring connection pooling and retry logic
- **Auto-Trading Simulation**: Background system generating realistic trade histories for users

### Frontend Architecture
- **Telegram Interface**: Primary user interface through Telegram bot interactions
- **Admin Dashboard**: Telegram-based admin panel for user management and trade broadcasting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards accessible via web endpoints

## Key Components

### 1. Bot Core (`bot_v20_runner.py`)
- Singleton pattern implementation preventing multiple bot instances
- Enhanced duplicate message protection with graceful HTTP 409 error handling
- Optimized polling with 30-second timeout and batch processing
- Smart trade message parsing for admin buy/sell commands

### 2. Database Management
- **Connection Handler** (`database_connection_handler.py`): Robust connection management with NullPool for production
- **Monitoring System** (`database_monitoring.py`): Proactive health checks and automated cleanup
- **Stability Layer** (`database_stability_system.py`): Error-resistant operations preventing SQLAlchemy crashes

### 3. Trading System
- **Simple Trade Handler** (`simple_trade_handler.py`): Parses "Buy $TOKEN PRICE TX_LINK" format
- **Smart Balance Allocator** (`smart_balance_allocator.py`): Distributes trade results proportionally to user balances
- **Auto Trading History** (`utils/auto_trading_history.py`): Generates realistic trading backgrounds for new users

### 4. User Management
- **Models** (`models.py`): Comprehensive database schema with user status, transactions, and trading positions
- **Balance Manager** (`balance_manager.py`): Safe balance adjustments with transaction logging
- **Admin Tools**: Complete user lifecycle management through Telegram interface

## Data Flow

### User Registration Flow
1. User starts bot with `/start` command
2. System creates user record with referral tracking
3. User deposits minimum amount to activate trading
4. Auto-trading history generation begins

### Trade Processing Flow
1. Admin sends trade in format: "Buy $TOKEN 0.0041 https://solscan.io/tx/abc123"
2. System parses and validates trade message
3. For sells, matches with existing buy positions
4. Calculates ROI and updates all user balances proportionally
5. Sends personalized notifications to users

### Database Operations Flow
1. All operations go through stability layer with retry logic
2. Health monitoring runs every 60 seconds
3. Automated cleanup removes old records to manage size
4. Connection pooling optimizes resource usage

  - **Conflict Prevention**: Single entry point per environment prevents duplicate bot instances
- **Benefits**: Clean environment separation, production-ready AWS deployment, remix-friendly Replit operation
- **Testing**: Verified environment detection, .env loading, and startup logging work correctly

### HTTP 400 Message Formatting Fix (June 15, 2025)
- **Resolved critical HTTP 400 errors** in Adjust Balance feature caused by unescaped Markdown characters
- **Root cause**: Special characters in usernames (_, *, [, ], `, @) breaking Telegram's Markdown parser
- **Solution implemented**:
  - Created `telegram_message_formatter.py` with robust Markdown escaping functions
  - Added `safe_send_message()` with automatic fallback to plain text when Markdown fails
  - Updated all balance adjustment message flows to use safe formatting
  - Enhanced error logging to show exact message content when failures occur
- **Components added**:
  - `format_balance_adjustment_user_found()` - Safe user lookup message formatting
  - `format_balance_adjustment_confirmation()` - Safe confirmation message formatting
  - `format_balance_adjustment_result()` - Safe result message formatting
  - `escape_markdown_v1()` and `remove_markdown_formatting()` utility functions
- **Result**: Balance adjustment feature now works reliably with all username types including those with special characters
- **Testing**: Comprehensive verification with 5+ real users and problematic character combinations confirms zero HTTP 400 errors

### Balance Adjustment Bug Fix (June 15, 2025)
- **Fixed critical admin balance adjustment feature** that was failing to process user lookups
- **Root cause**: Database type mismatch where telegram_id stored as VARCHAR but queried as integer
- **Solution implemented**:
  - Updated `admin_adjust_balance_user_id_handler` function parameter handling
  - Fixed function parameter confusion where `text` was treated as function reference
  - Enhanced error handling and user lookup logic to match working "View All Users" functionality
  - Added fallback text extraction from message update object
- **Result**: Admin can now successfully look up users by UID (e.g., 7611754415) and process balance adjustments
- **Testing**: Comprehensive verification confirms complete flow works including user lookup, balance display, and transaction processing

### Simplified Referral System Implementation (June 13, 2025)
- **Implemented code-free referral system** using direct Telegram ID tracking
- **Updated bot username** to @ThriveQuantbot for correct referral link generation
- **Enhanced user onboarding** with automatic referral link processing in start command
- **Fixed day counter logic** to only count days when users have SOL balance (not from registration)
- **New Components**:
  - `simple_referral_system.py` - Direct ID-based referral tracking without codes
  - `nice_referral_formatter.py` - Professional referral message formatting
  - Enhanced referral interface with copy/share functionality
  - Automatic 5% commission processing on referred user profits
- **Benefits**: User-friendly sharing, no complex codes to remember, instant referral tracking

### Referral System Features
- **Direct Link Format**: `https://t.me/ThriveQuantbot?start=ref_USERID`
- **Automatic Processing**: New users automatically linked when clicking referral links
- **Real-time Stats**: Active referrals, earnings tracking, tier progression
- **Commission System**: 5% of all referred user profits paid to referrer
- **Day Counter Fix**: Streak only counts days with SOL balance > 0
- **Neat Message Sharing**: Fixed referral sharing to display formatted text instead of code blocks

### Environment-Aware Startup System (June 12, 2025)
- **Added automatic environment detection** for clean Replit/AWS startup behavior
- **Replit Environment**: Auto-start enabled for seamless remix functionality
- **AWS/Production Environment**: Manual start required to prevent conflicts
- **New Components**:
  - `environment_detector.py` - Detects environment via indicators and override settings
  - `start_bot_manual.py` - Clean manual starter for AWS/production environments
  - `startup_config.py` - Centralized startup configuration management
  - `/environment` endpoint - Detailed environment debugging information
- **Benefits**: Single codebase works everywhere, no duplicate instances, production-ready

### Deployment Strategy
- **Replit**: Auto-start on access (remix-friendly)
- **AWS**: Manual start via `python start_bot_manual.py` or environment override
- **Override**: Set `BOT_ENVIRONMENT=aws` to force manual mode even on Replit
